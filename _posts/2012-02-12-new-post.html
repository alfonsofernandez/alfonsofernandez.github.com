	I was trying to get Octopress working on a Mac OS 10.7.3 with XCode 4.3.                  <br>
	I found this great resource:              <br>
	 <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/3963/comment-page-1#comment-265675">http://aralbalkan.com/3963/comment-page-1#comment-265675</a>                     <br>
	But bundle install fails with XCode 4.3    <br>
	You can find the reason here     <br>

	And fix it with                          <br>
	sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/               <br>
